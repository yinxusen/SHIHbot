question 0: Can I be infected with hepatitis C more than once?
answer 0: Although most research is in subtype B, several groups have reported very little difference between either rates of disease progression, or responses to treatment in people with sub-type B compared to other subtypes, including a UK study which compared 81 people with sub-type C to 408 people with subtype B.Several studies including one from the UK and one from France, have also reported that there does not seem to be significant differences in response to treatment by subtype.For you, it is probably more important to focus on your individual results in terms of CD4 and viral load counts, and then adherence when you come to start treatment.Some research suggests that subtype C may be more vulnerable to some types of resistance (to NNRTIs when single dose nevirapine was used to prevent mother-to-child transmission; and to the K65R mutation associated with tenofovir resistance). In practice, this just means you need to be very good with adherence if you use these drugs in your combination in the future â though this is good advice for all drugs in all people.In summary, there appear to be no major differences that affect your progression or response to treatment, but how you manage you health is very individual. When you come to use treatment, make sure you have all the information you need to get the best response, and be very careful to be adherent.

question 1: What do I need to know about pregnancy and HIV infection?
answer 1: People with HIV should be tested for hepatitis A: hepatitis B: and hepatitis C. These illnesses can cause severe liver problems: especially in people with HIV. Hepatitis A is commonly spread through contaminated food or water. HepatitisB and hepatitis C can be spread through unprotected sex or by sharing needles with a person who has either of these viruses. People with HIV should talk to their doctor about their risk for hepatitis: how to avoid infection: and whether they should receive vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B (there is no vaccine for hepatitis C). There are treatments available for hepatitis B and hepatitis C: but they do not work for everyone.

question 2: Can you reduce the risk of getting HIV after having unprotected sex with someone who has HIV?
answer 2: Its actaully quit difficult to contract HIV. It is a case of bad luck. If your partner is on treatment, then the risks are close to zero. Please see the PARTNER study:
 http://i-base.info/htb/30108If your partner is not on treatment, there are risks and you may eventually become infected. For transmission please see:
 http://i-base.info/guides/testing

question 3: Why should you bother using condoms to prevent transmission when HIV is treatable?
answer 3: I'm still learning, I will have to get back to you on that question.

question 4: If taking anti-HIV drugs has made your viral load undetectable, can you still pass the virus to another person through sex?
answer 4: Any person infected with HIV: even if he or she has no symptoms: can  to another person. Risk reduction measures still need to be taken.

question 5: What are the risks of getting HIV if you put on a condom after you've already started having sex?
answer 5: PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is only for people who are at ongoing very high risk of HIV infection. But PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is an option for someone who thinks they’ve recently been exposed to HIV during sex or through sharing needles and works to prepare drugs. PEP means taking antiretroviral medicines after a potential exposure to HIV to prevent becoming infected. PEP must be started within 72 hours of possible exposure to HIV. If you’re prescribed PEP, you’ll need to take it once or twice daily for 28 days.

question 6: Should a woman douche after a condom breaks?
answer 6: Douching after sex does not provide protection against HIV transmissionbecause semen enters the cervical canal almost immediately after ejaculation.There is also no evidence that douching after anal sex offers any HIV protection.Douching can irritate vaginal tissues and make it easier to become infected bysexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV. It can cause infection by disruptingthe natural balance of bacteria and yeast in the vagina and it can actuallycomplicate an existing infection.

question 7: What are the chances of a man being infected with HIV after unprotected sex with a woman?
answer 7: Your reaction is common for someone who has had an exposure. There is no way to know if you are positive without having a test. It is important to know that HIV is actually a difficult virus to catch. HIV is not transmitted every time that you have sex with someone who has HIV. The risk from a single exposure like this is actually low. There a couple of reasons for this. For example you were not at risk of transmission while the condom was not broken yet. Insertive sex is also lower risk than receptive sex.The risk of transmission is also lower if your girlfriend is on treatment. She should also have had something called a viral load test. Someones viral load tells you how much virus is in their bloodstreat. The lower this is the lower the risk of transmission is.If your partner is not on treatment the risk of transmission is about 1 in 500. If she is on treatment it could be 1 in 10,000. This could be even lower if she has an undetectable viral load. All of this means that you are more likely to be negative than positive.It is still a good idea to get tested. In this situation it is the only way to know if you are negative or positive.You can find more information about HIV transmission here.

question 8: Can you get HIV through oral sex?
answer 8: It is very difficult to put an exact number on likelihood of transmission as there are so many different factors involved in transmission. This is why many scientists and doctors prefer to simply say ‘low risk’ or ‘high risk’.There have been several studies which look at transmission through oral sex and all data appears to show slightly different outcomes. If you follow this link to a discussion between several experts regarding the relative risk of getting HIV through receptive oral sex with and without ejaculation you can see that discussions bring up many different figures based on several key studies.Eventually this discussion concludes that the risk of getting HIV as a receptive partner with ejaculation into the mouth and without cuts in the mouth or any other STI on the insertive penis, is estimated to be between 1-5%. However, this does not take into account the insertive partner’s viral load, which has been shown to be a very important factor in HIV transmission.In the study that you mention which can be found online here the researchers did look into the viral load of the study participants. Although viral load varied from undetectable to over 10,000 copies there were still no HIV infections seen from oral sex over the 10 year study period. This is not to say there is no risk at all as the study population of 135 people (of which 25 were men giving oral sex to women) is still very small.This emphasizes the difficulty of putting exact figures on HIV transmission. Studies are now starting to show that HIV treatment is as effective if not more effective at reducing transmission than any other form of protection. Once the viral load of a HIV positive person is undetectable for over 6 months the likelihood of transmission is almost zero.A recent study looking at 3,400 sero-discordant heterosexual couples (one HIV positive and one HIV negative) across southern Africa found that out of the 103 people who got HIV from their partner, only 1 was on treatment and that person had only just started treatment when their partner became infected meaning their viral load would have still been quite high. Details of this study can be found here and it is also reviewed in HIV treatment bulletin at this link.For any further information please contact us via the website, e-mail or through the treatment information phoneline (Mon-Wed 12-4pm).Best wishes for the future with your new partner.

question 9: Is it safe for an HIV-positive person to have unprotected sex with another HIV-positive person?
answer 9: Sex can be as normal and healthy part of life whether or not you have HIV.Being HIV-positive will not in itself cause having sex to have any bad effect on your health.You need to use condoms to make sure that you do not pass HIV on to partners who are HIV-negative, and to protect yourslef from other sexually transmitted infections.

question 10: Will cleaning IV-drug needles and syringes with bleach before using them prevent you from getting HIV?
answer 10: Step 1. Rinse with water to remove blood from syringe/needle. Pour clean water into clean cup or bottle cap. Pull back on plunger and fill halfway with clean water. Shake syringe/needle and squirt water out through the syringe/needle. Repeat this at least twice with new water or until all the blood and drugresidue is gone.Step 2. Rinse with full strength bleach. Pour full strength bleach (do not add water) into clean cup or bottle cap. Pull back on plunger and fill the syringe halfway with bleach. Shake syringe/needle and squirt bleach out through the syringe/needle. Repeat steps.Step 3. Rinse syringe/needle with clean water three more times. Before injecting: always rinse syringe/needle with water to remove thebleach. Keep the rinse water apart from water used to clean the syringe/needle andto prepare drugs.Things to remember: Do not reuse the cotton: water: bleach: or cooker. If the cooker must bereused: rinse it in bleach and then water. Store bleach in a container that is opaque (you can’t see through it). Bleachloses its effectiveness with exposure to light. Label the container “bleach.” Never assume that a syringe purchased on the street is new: even if it seemsto be packaged as new. The easiest place to get new syringes is at an ESAPpharmacy or a Syringe Exchange Program ( 53).

question 11: Can two HIV-positive parents have an HIV-negative child?
answer 11: To provide the best medical care: health care providers need to know the HIV status of their patients. It is against the law for health care providers to deny care to people with HIV because of their HIV status. By law: health care providers must keep your HIV status confidential.

question 12: Can a couple in which one person is HIV positive conceive a baby without passing the virus to the uninfected partner?
answer 12: Itâs great that you are thinking of having children.Many couples like yours, with one positive and one negative partner safely have children. This is done using HIV treatment. You do not say who the positive one is. If you, or your partner is not already on treatment you would start. After a few months the risk of transmission is extremely low, close to zero.You would then conceive naturally. If the positive partner is the one becoming pregnant the treatment would also protect the baby from getting HIV.You should speak to your clinic about this. They can help you with information about how to do this.You can also find lots of information about pregnancy on our website.

question 13: Can you get HIV or hepatitis C from blood or organs received from another person?
answer 13: You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. HIV is not spread easily. Only certain body fluids from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV: blood, semen, pre-cum, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. These body fluids must come into contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into your bloodstream (by a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth. HIV is not spread by mosquitoes, water or air, saliva, tears, sweat, shaking hands, hugging, sharing toilets, sharing dishes/drinking glasses, or closed-mouth or âsocialâ/"french" kissing with someone who is HIV-positive.

question 14: Will PrEP still protect me from HIV even if I don't take it every day?
answer 14: I'm still learning, I will have to get back to you on that question.

question 15: I recently heard about someone who got HIV while taking PrEP. What happened? Should I be afraid to take PrEP?
answer 15: PrEP is for people without HIV who are at very high risk for getting it from sex or injection drug use. The federal guidelines recommend that PrEP be considered for people who are HIV-negative and in an ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV-positive partner. This recommendation also includes anyone who, PrEP is also recommended for people who have injected drugs in the past 6 months and have shared needles or works or been in drug treatment in the past 6 months. If you have a partner who is HIV-positive and are considering getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about PrEP if youâre not already taking it. PrEP may be an option to help protect you and your baby from getting HIV infection while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding. Because PrEP involves daily medication and regular visits to a health care provider, it may not be right for everyone. And PrEP may cause side effects like nausea in some people, but these generally subside over time. These side effects arenât life threatening. See <a href="#PrEP_safe">Is PrEP safe?</a>, * Mutually monogamous means that you and your partner only have sex with each other and do not have sex outside the relationship.

question 16: I heard that Descovy is a safer version of Truvada. Can I use it for PrEP?
answer 16: A doctor can prescribe an approved medicine privately if they believe it is medically appropriate for patient. However, the cost for these meds in a UK pharmacy is likely to be too expensive for most people to be able to afford.Although the NHS is working through its process for deciding when and if the NHS will pay for PrEP, this is still likely to take some time. A lot of people are trying to have this decision soon, but it might not be until much later this year. However, based on the PROUD results, it looks like PrEP might easily be cost-effective for people who are at high risk.Until the NHS makes this decision, the results from PROUD mean that lots of other people are in a similar situation to yourself. Some people are getting PrEP in other ways.Because some people might find other ways to use access PrEP, the information below highlights issues for anyone doing this.Anyone using PrEP in these ways in the UK should do this with the knowledge of a doctor. This shows the urgency for the NHS to provide support for PrEP in sexual health clinics.The following main points are:See these related questions:For further information about the PROUD study, please see the following links:Note: This question was updated on 10 July 2015 from an initial post from 11 June 2015, mainly to include new information about legality of importing generic medicines for personal use.

question 17: I am a transgender woman. Will taking PrEP affect my hormone therapy?
answer 17: I’m sorry to hear about your diagnosis. How are you doing?Learning you are HIV positive affects people in different ways but it is still usually difficult. It is often more difficult if you are doing this on your own and I wondered whether you have any support or whether you have been able to talk to anyone.There are many HIV positive people who are also transgender – or many trangender people who also are HIV positive. Either way, you are not on your own in this, but you will want to make sure your medical care is managed by someone who understands your situation.Some HIV meds have the potential to reduce oestrogen levels, so the choice of HIV treatment will be made carefully with an awareness of drug interactions.Your doctor can talk about options that include adjust your oestrogen dosing or use HIV meds that have no interactions. This decision will be individualised for you depending on your HIV treatment history and available choices.If you also want to do your own research, Liverpool University have an excellent online drug-interaction resource.http://www.hiv-druginteractions.orgThe online drug interaction charts let you first select HIV meds. You can then select potential interactions by generic name or by drug class. For example, selecting “Contraceptives/HRT” lists 12 hormones. Clicking “Finish” will produce a traffic light summary for potential interactions: red is a warning, orange a caution and green is all clear. You can also print a personal PDF report that explains each of these interactions in detail.[Note – for a trans* man there are 15 steroids listed in that drug class].How are you doing otherwise? Are you getting support from family or friends, or another organisation?CliniQ is sexual health and well-being service for trans people in the UK. This is an NHS clinic that was created by and for trans people. They are a great resource if you want further support and information.CliniQ website:

question 18: What should my partner and I know about taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection?
answer 18: I am not confident on an answer for that question.

question 19: Would you know whether you're infected with HIV without getting tested?
answer 19: I'm not sure! I think Google might have a better answer.

question 20: How soon after risky sex can you be 100% sure you are clear of HIV?
answer 20: Generally there is no greater risk through surgery if you are HIV positive, than for HIV negative patients. Studies have shown an increased risk of post-operative complications with a CD4 count under 200, or a very high viral load. Because your CD4 is strong, and you are undetectable, this does not apply in your case.

question 21: How accurate is the rapid oral HIV test?
answer 21: The Tri-Dot test is a rapid HIV antibody test that is very accurate and sensitive at detecting HIV infection. Getting a negative result means that you are HIV-negative.If you have been potentially exposed to HIV over the 3 months before taking the test – I don’t think this is the case because you have been using condoms – then you could confirm this with another test in three months.Your girlfriend will now need to have other blood tests including a CD4 test to check whether HIV has damaged her immune system and whether she needs to start treatment, and a viral load test if this is available in your country. She should also see a doctor about the ulcer.You do not need to take any prophylaxis treatment for your own health, but you will need to make sure you continue to use a condom during sex.The following link show results that show that the TriDot test has over 99.9% reliability.

question 22: What do "inconclusive" test results mean on a home HIV test?
answer 22: Some tests (not in the UK) include a number with the result.So long as it is below 1.0 the number itself has little meaning. For example, 0.68 is not worse than 0.38. A higher number below 1.0 does NOT indicate a higher chance of having HIV.If the number is close to 1.0 â for example between 0.9 and 1.0, the test might be run again.Please see this link for more.

question 23: Can I take hep C medications along with my HIV medications?
answer 23: I will answer your questions based on the numbers you have given above.1. Flomist is a generic form of fluticasone which is a steroid. There are potential interactions between fluticasone, salmeterol and certain types of ARV.All of the nukes or Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) have the potential to interact with both fluticasone and salmeterol. There is also a potential interaction with Delavirdine which is a non-nuke or a Non-Nucleoside Reverse transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) but no interactions with the other NNRTIs.There have been reports of interactions between inhaled fluticasone and ritonavir which is a protease inhibitor and is also used as a booster to other protease inhibitors. There have also been new drug interaction warnings for advair and severent (both contain salmeterol), they should not be combined with protease inhibitors.Where there are potential interactions with ARVs this can either cause the medication to not work as it should or can cause bad side effects. When you reach the time to start your medication you should discuss all the possibilities of drug interactions with your HIV doctor.2. Exercise is a good thing and will help to keep your body healthy especially if it is combined with a nutritious diet. Providing you are not exercising excessively, running should not affect your CD4 count.3. When you reach the time to take HIV medication it is important that you find the regimen to fits in with your lifestyle. This way you are more likely to adhere to your treatment.Some medications require that you take them with food, some require that you don’t eat for two hours before you take them and others can be taken with or without food. You should discuss this with your doctor when deciding which medication to start.When you start medication it is important to think carefully about what time would be best suited to fit in with your lifestyle. Once you decide which time to take your medication you should try and take the medication within an hour either side of that time. For example, if you decide to take your medication at 9am you can take it anytime between 8am and 10am. The closer to the time you have decided to take your medication, the better it is. An hour either side will not affect the drug levels in your blood very much.to the i-Base ‘Introduction to Combination Therapy’ guide.

question 24: Why change your HIV regimen when you've been on it for years, and it's working?
answer 24: Firstly, this is to confirm that this service is based on information relating to treatment of all people who are HIV positive. Not just Jehovahâs witnesses.In response to your question, the way people react when you disclose your status varies according to individuals. Some people choose to leave their partners. Others feel that they love their partners too much to let HIV alone come between them. How people react depends on the type of person they are and how informed they are about HIV.In reality though itâs important to be prepared for either reaction. Your partner may not ready to be with you if you test HIV positive. However, if this is the case, then are they really the right person to spend the rest of your life with?Can I ask whether you are HIV positive and if your fiance left you after you disclosed?In general, many HIV negative people continue to have fulfilling sexual relationships with their positive partners. Others even go on to start families if that is what they wish. Many more have had and continue to have healthy HIV negative babies.Best wishes.

question 25: If you change to new HIV medicines (ARVs), can you go back to the old ones in the future?
answer 25: I'm still learning, I will have to get back to you on that question.

question 26: When should you start antiretroviral therapy?
answer 26: There are different combination therapies for HIV-positive people nowadays. There is a combination with all three compounds in one pill, so the best scenario is 1 pill once daily. Other people may need to take 2-3 pills daily, sometimes more.There is more information on treatment and other aspects of HIV treatment at the following link:http://i-base.info/guides/starting

question 27: Is there a once-a-day pill for HIV?
answer 27: I am not confident on an answer for that question.

question 28: What is drug resistance in HIV and how can you avoid it?
answer 28: Drug resistance happens when HIV mutates: or changes itself: so that the HIV medicines a person is taking are no longer effective. People who become resistant to one drug may also become resistant to other drugs: including drugs they have never taken. Tests are available to help find out whether a person is resistant to any HIV medicine. Drug resistance is much less likely to develop if the amount of HIV in a personâs body is kept as low as possible. That is why it is important that people with HIV take their HIV medicines as prescribed and not skip doses. Case managers: adherence counselors: and treatment educators can help people with HIV figure out strategies for taking their HIV medicines successfully.

question 29: What should you do if you miss a dose of your HIV medicines?
answer 29: f you have missed a dose you should take it as soon as you remember. If you have only realised when youâre taking your next dose do not take a double dose. Almost everyone will be late or miss a dose occasionally. However this becomes a concern if it is happening regularly.If you are regularly missing doses you are at risk of developing resistance. This means that you meds will stop working effectively. This is why adherence is important. Adherence means taking your meds every day and as close to the same time as possible.If you are you can talk to your clinic about why you are missing doses. If it is because of side effects for example there might be different meds available.There is more detail about what you should do if you miss a dose in this treatment training guideAnd more information about adherence in our online guide to treatment.

question 30: Can you take a break from your HIV medicines?
answer 30: Everything in HIV care should be individualised. So there may be some people, and some circumstances where the advantages of a treatment break are greater than the risks. In general, treatment breaks are not a good idea and this is something you will need to discuss with your doctor.The SMART study showed that interrupting treatment carries an increased risk of serious, including fatal, complications that we previously thought might be related to treatment.In SMART, people who interrupted treatment were 3 to 4 times more likely to have a heart attack, or serious liver or kidney disease, compared to people who stayed on treatment and who had an undetectable viral load. These results were unexpected and caused this large international study to close after only two years. See this HTB report for results first presented in February 2006.The study also showed that the drop in CD4 count that people in the study got when they stopped treatment was very difficult to gain back. Even 18 months after restarting treatment, CD4 counts still remained an average of 100 CD4 cells lower than at the start of the study. See this HTB report for details.Putting the SMART results into context though is more complicated. The actual ‘absolute’ risk of a serious illness was still fairly low. Over 95% of the almost 3000 people who took the treatment break did not experience a serious AIDS-defining illness. The ‘relative’ risk – the rate of serious events in the interruption group compared to being on continuous effective treatment – was still 3-4 times higher. So you are left knowing something is generally unlikely, but significantly more likely, when off meds. Tricky to explain and understand.The researchers are still trying to find out whether it is possible to find out why the treatment break was so risky in some people. This recent analysis showing that having detectable viral load increases markers of immune activation and inflammation may have some of the answers.Until then, your doc is likely to say it is a bad idea, unless you have really difficult side effects, really poor adherence, a really strong CD4 count (and you started treatment with a high CD4 count), and based on the most recent SMART results, you have particularly low levels of D-dimer and IL-6.Sorry to have answered in such detail Me? I’m staying on treatment til they find the cure…

question 31: Will HIV medicines cause changes to your fat and stomach?
answer 31: A lower sex drive is more common in HIV positive people due to both medical and psychological reasons. HIV positive men and women have less testosterone which can result in a lower libido. It is also possible that your partner is worrying about infecting you with HIV and this is causing him to lose his sex drive.Other non-HIV-realted factors include age (over 40), diabetes, hypertension, depression, use of steroids, fear of failure, stress.HIV-related sexual dysfunction is more usually associated with people who are not on treatment.For more information on sexual dysfunction in HIV positive people please follow this link or read this similar question

question 32: Is it true that someone has been cured of HIV?
answer 32: This news about this case was presented at an HIV medical conference (Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections) in Atlanta on 4th March 2013.Researchers reported that a 26-month old child no longer has detectable virus (using standard tests) after five months off treatment. The child had been born with HIV and given antiretroviral drugs from when she was 30 hours old for about 18 months,But although the researchers could still detect HIV at very low levels, this was close to the levels of sensitivity for the test. This means the child may not have been completely cured of HIV but this is what is called a “functional cure”. This means that she may still be infected but does not require treatment at the moment. It is not known whether her HIV might become detectable and she will need treatment in the future.So how did this happen?It is uncommon for babies to be born with HIV in Europe or America (where the child lives). This is because mothers are usually tested for HIV in pregnancy and treated with antiretrovirals if they are positive.In this case, the mother’s HIV status was not discovered in time to give her antiretroviral treatment (ART) when she was still pregnant. HIV tests on the baby when she was two days old confirmed that she was also infected.The baby was immediately given ART using nevirapine, AZT and 3TC. She was tested (viral load test) at seven, 12 and 20 days after starting treatment and all these tests showed she had detectable virus. But when she was tested at 29 days she had an undetectable viral load. This continued to be undetectable until she was 18 months old.Then the mother and child did not come back to the clinic for five months. When they returned to the clinic and the child was tested again, her doctors were surprised to find that her viral load was still undetectable. This was despite not having been taking ART.The child was then tested with very sensitive tests. Some of these tests found tiny amounts of HIV but these viral particles were not able to replicate. This may mean that the baby is not infectious.The child has now been off treatment for a year and her viral load continues to be undetectable.Now researchers will look at whether a functional cure is possible for other babies in the same situation. This could lead to important new strategies for mothers and babies, particularly in poor countries where the majority of vertical transmissions take place.For more information about this baby, see TAG’s Richard Jefferys has an excellent blog and has described this case in detail. He also regularly reports on other cure and basic science research.http://tagbasicscienceproject.typepad.com/tags_basic_science_vaccin/2013/03/report-of-a-functional-cure-in-an-hiv-infected-infant.htmlThe presentation is online (it is the seventh presentation in the session “Is there hope for HIV eradication”).

question 33: Should you get a flu shot?
answer 33: It is recommended that HIV positive people get the annual flu vaccination. To read a study explaining the benefits of the flu jab in people with HIV please follow this link.If your CD4 count is 360 then you should be starting to think about HIV treatment options. For further information it may help to read the i-Base âIntroduction to Combination Therapyâ guidebook.

question 34: What's the difference between the flu and a cold?
answer 34: I'm still learning, I will have to get back to you on that question.

question 35: Is it safe to treat the flu when you are on HIV medications?
answer 35: I'm not sure! I think Google might have a better answer.

question 36: How long can people infected with HIV expect to live?
answer 36: Medicines that fight HIV have helped many people with HIV and AIDS live year sand even decades longer than was possible in the past: before effective treatment was available. HIV treatments are not a cure: and they do not work equally well for everyone: but they have extended the lives of many people with HIV and AIDS. Without treatment: some people live for just a few years after getting HIV. Others live much longer. Researchers are studying a small number of people with HIV who have not become ill for more than ten years: even without any HIV treatment. However: these people are still infected with HIV and can pass the virus to others.

question 37: Will having hepatitis C cause problems with your HIV?
answer 37: Generally co-infection between HIV and HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) complicates each disease. HIV can cause HCV to progress more quickly. Similarly co-infection with HCV can cause HIV positive people to respond to their medication less well causing lower CD4 counts.It would be useful to know your CD4 count when you started treatment but you are doing well on treatment and this is a good thing as it means that you HIV is controlled..It is important that you have a doctor who specialises in coinfection.The Fibroscan test measures the elasticity or stiffness of the liver to show progression of HCV. A Fibroscan test of 7.5 indicates a higher likelihood of fibrosis, but interpretation of the result by your expert are important.Deciding if and when to use HCV treatment is also very individual.The best thing you can do to help your liver is to cut out alcohol. Other things include drinking plenty of water, eating fewer fatty or salty food and eating more fresh fruit, vegetables and high-fibre foods. The longer your liver stays healthy the longer you stay healthy.For more information follow this link to the i-Base guide to HCV coinfection.
